# What is the difference between Javascript For-In, and For-Of loops ? 

In JavaScript, the `for...of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc. It provides a simpler syntax compared to the traditional for loop when you want to loop through the values of an iterable object without worrying about indexes or accessing elements by index.


<b>Here's the basic syntax of the for...of loop:</b></br>
`for (variable of iterable) {</br>
    // code block to be executed</br>
}`</br>
